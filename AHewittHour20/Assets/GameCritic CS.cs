        print("Difficulty: A reason why this game is hard is because you have to platform on blocks to get over the wall. However, it is easy if you look closely at the wall you will find a block that you can jump on to easily get over the wall. Also, if you walk backwards you will drop to a hidden platform below the ground. \nChanges to change the difficulty: If I knew how to program an AI, I would insert enemies to make it more challenging, and I could probably make an alternate level where you have to navigate a maze to get out in only ten seconds. \nFun: I would say that items that make the game more fun are the obstacles because they can slow you down, but respectfully make the game more difficult. I added a glowing sphere in an attempt to replicate the physics of the Chaosball project. \nTediousness: At first, I found the time limit to be the most tedious element. It is especially tedious because you cannot continue after the time has ended. The parkour to jump over the wall is also difficult because you have to construct your jumps accordingly. \nWow: The only wow thing that comes to mind about this game is the hidden ground beneath the ground, and the camoflauged block by the wall. In future independent Unity projects, I wonder what other images can be added to the background.");
